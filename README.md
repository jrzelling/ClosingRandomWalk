# Closing Random Walk

## ClosingRandomWalk.nb
Generates a 3D random walk of a specified length (can be changed), and then using 3D transforms, copies the walk four times and it closes on itself. Was used for a demonstration of R which is not part of this repository. 

The function continually generates a csv file of coordinates and to visualize different paths, manually run the function (Shift-Enter) to read different csv files into the plot output.

## RandomWalk2D.nb
Generates a simple csv file of a 2D random walk. Not really useful for anything except generalizing to higher dimensions.
